INTRO                                                           *sayonara-intro*
                                                                     *:Sayonara*

This plugin provides a single command that closes the current buffer in a
smart way.

Basically you don't have to think in terms of |:bdelete|, |:close|, |:quit|
etc. anymore, since the plugin does that for you.

It reduces cognitive load and lets you focus on the main task: editing text.

It deletes the current buffer. If there are no other listed buffers (see
|unlisted-buffers|), it will close the current window. If this is the last
window in the tabpage, it will close the tabpage. If it's the last tabpage,
it will quit Vim.

If the buffer contains unsaved changes, you'll be prompted on what to do.

If a window with an associated |location-list| is closed, the location list
will be closed as well.

This deletes the current buffer but preserves the window. If there are no
other buffers to switch to, an empty scrach buffer will be created instead.

You'll probably want to map |:Sayonara| to something more convenient, e.g.:
>
    nnoremap <leader>q :Sayonara<cr>
    nnoremap <leader>Q :Sayonara!<cr>
<
Or maybe |gs|, because usually nobody will need its default functionality:
>
    nnoremap gs :Sayonara<cr>
    nnoremap gS :Sayonara!<cr>
