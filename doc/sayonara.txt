This plugin provides a single command that deletes the current buffer in a
smart way.

Basically you don't have to think in terms of |:bdelete|, |:close|, |:quit|
etc. anymore, since the plugin does that for you.

It reduces cognitive load and lets you focus on the main task: editing text.

    :Sayonara

This deletes the current buffer and possibly also closes the current window.
>
    :Sayonara!
<
This deletes the current buffer but preserves the current window.

See |sayonara-details| to learn how these commands work in detail.

MAPPINGS                                                     *sayonara-mappings*

Everyone prefers different mappings, so there are no default ones.

Nevertheless you'll probably want to map |:Sayonara| to something more
convenient, e.g.:
>
    nnoremap <leader>q :Sayonara<cr>
    nnoremap <leader>Q :Sayonara!<cr>
<
Or maybe |gs|, because usually nobody will need its default functionality:
>
    nnoremap gs :Sayonara<cr>
    nnoremap gS :Sayonara!<cr>

DETAILS                                                       *sayonara-details*

First of all, :Sayonara or :Sayonara! will always delete the current buffer.
If the buffer contains unsaved changes, you'll be prompted on what to do.

The difference between :Sayonara and :Sayonara! is about how the current
window (the source window) is handled, but no matter which variant you use,
these things will happen first for both of them:

Search all windows in all tabpages that contain the target buffer (except the
source window!) and preserve them. Preserving means either switching to the
previous buffer or creating an empty buffer in case there are no other listed
buffers.

This is important, because otherwise |:bdelete| would simply close all these
windows.

Now come the differences:

For :Sayonara! it's easy. Like the other windows before, the source window
will be preserved and the target buffer deleted.

For :Sayonara it's a bit more complicated, since it's designed to Do The Right
Thing in a variety of different cases.

If there are multiple windows in the current tabpage, the current window will
be closed as well.

If there is only a single window in the current tabpage, one of two things can
happen:

  - there other listed buffers: switch to the previous buffer
  - there are no other listed buffers: either the current tabpage is closed
    or, if this is the only tabpage, Vim will quit

NOTE: If a window with an associated |location-list| is closed, the location
list will be closed, too.
