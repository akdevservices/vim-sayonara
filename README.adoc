This plugin provides a single helper command, `:Sayonara`, that deletes a
buffer and also quits the window if it makes more. You basically don't have to
think in terms of `:bdelete` or `:quit` anymore.

If it's a modified buffer, you'll get asked, if you really want to delete it.

`:Sayonara` deletes the current buffer and closes the window if there are no
more listed buffers.

`:Sayonara!` deletes the current buffer but preserves the window. If there's no
other listed buffer that can be switched to, an empty scratch buffer is
created.

Alternatively `:Sayonara` takes an argument which is either a buffer number or
a buffer name. You can also list all valid arguments via `<c-d>` or complete
them via `<tab>`.
