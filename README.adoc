This plugin provides a single helper command, `:Sayonara`, that deletes a
buffer and also quits the window if it makes sense. You basically don't have to
think in terms of `:bdelete` or `:quit` anymore.

If it's a modified buffer, you'll get asked, if you really want to delete it.

`:Sayonara` deletes the current buffer and closes the window if there are no
more listed buffers.

`:Sayonara!` deletes the current buffer but preserves the window. If there's no
other listed buffer that can be switched to, an empty scratch buffer is
created.

Alternatively `:Sayonara` takes an argument which is either a buffer number or
a buffer name. You can also list all valid arguments via `<c-d>` or complete
them via `<tab>`.

*Examples*:

Close current buffer but preserve the window:

`:Sayonara!`

Close buffer that is associated with number 7:

`:Sayonara 7`

Buffer numbers take priority over names, so if you have a buffer number 7 and
another buffer named "7", do this instead:

`:Sayonara '7'` (Single and not double quotes!)

Personally I use these mappings for convenience:

```vim
nnoremap <silent><leader>q    :Sayonara<cr>
nnoremap <silent><leader>Q    :Sayonara!<cr>
```

So usually I just have to hit `<leader>q` and the plugin does what I want.

== Installation and Documentation

If you have no preferred installation method, I suggest using
https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug[vim-plug]. Afterwards installing
vim-sayonara is as easy as pie.

Add this to your vimrc:

    Plug 'mhinz/vim-sayonara', { 'on': 'Sayonara' }

Restart Vim or `:source %` your vimrc. Then do `:PlugInstall` and vim-plug will
fetch and install vim-sayonara from Github.

It works without any configuration, but you might want to look into the
documentation for further customization:

    :h sayonara
